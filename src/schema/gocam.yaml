    notes:
      - Should be implemented as a stronger type

  category type:
    typeof: uriorcurie
    description: >-
      A primitive type in which the value denotes a class within the biolink model.
      The value must be a URI or a CURIE. In a Neo4j representation, the value should
      be the CURIE for the biolink class, for example biolink:Gene. For an RDF representation,
      the value should be a URI such as https://w3id.org/biolink/vocab/Gene

  iri type:
    typeof: uriorcurie
    description: >-
      An IRI

  label type:
    typeof: string
    description: >-
      A string that provides a human-readable name for an entity

  predicate type:
    typeof: uriorcurie
    description: >-
      A CURIE from the biolink related_to hierarchy.
      For example, biolink:related_to, biolink:causes, biolink:treats.
