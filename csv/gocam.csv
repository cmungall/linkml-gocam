activity_or_process,,
anatomical_entity,,"An instance of a GO cellular anatomical entity, a cell type, or gross anatomical structure"
anatomical_part_of_association,,"Connects an anatomical entity (such as a component, cell, or gross anatomical entity) to its parent parts"
association,,An association between a domain element (e.g. a MolecularActivity) and another domain element (e.g. another MolecularActivity) with evidence and provenance attached
biological_process,,An instance of a GO biological process
causal_association,,An association owned by an upstream MA or BP that connects to a downstream MA or BP. The nature of the causal relationship is indicated with the predicate.
chemical_entity,,"An instance of a chemical entity, as defined in CHEBI, including macromolecules defined in NEO"
continuant,,
domain_element,,An element that is part of a GO-CAM model
domain_element_mixin,,Grouping for mixins that apply to GO-CAM elements. These mixins allow us to group together elements that are alike in some fashion
element,,Base class for any biological entity or activity or process in a GO-CAM model
enabled_by_association,,Connects an MA to the information biomacromolecule that executes the activity
evidence,,"An instance of a piece of evidence. Evidence attributes such as type, reference, hang off of here"
happens_during_association,,Connects an MF to a process or phase in which the process occurs
has_input_association,,"Connects an MF or BP to its input entity, which may be a chemical entity, an information biomacromolecule, or a larger structure"
has_part_association,,General grouping for associations that Link an entity to its parts by a HasPartAssociation
information_biomacromolecule,,"This class groups gene, gene product (protein on ncRNA), or a macromolecular complex that is capable of carrying out a molecular activity"
information_element,,
macromolecule_has_part_association,,Connects a macromolecule (such as a protein complex) to its parts (gene products or chemical entities)
model,,"A collection of GO-CAM elements and associated metadata. A model combines multiple simple GO annotations into an integrated, semantically precise and computable model of biological function."
molecular_activity,,An instance of a GO molecular function
occurs_in_association,,An association owned by a MA or BP that connect to an AE object in which the activity/process is carried out
ontology_class,,
part_of_association,,General grouping for associations that Link an entity to its wholes by a PartOfAssociation
process_or_phase,,
process_part_of_association,,Connects a MA or BP to its parent parts
publication,,A published entity such as a paper in pubmed
